# Kadane-s-Algo
Explanation with program how Kadane's Algorithm Works

The Problem is given to you where you have to find the max sum of a Contiguous subarray.

It can be done with brute force but the problem is with complexity. 

- Brute Force Time Complexity - O(nÂ²)
- Kadane's Algorithm  Time Complexity - O(n)
